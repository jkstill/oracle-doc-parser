# DBA_INVALID_OBJECTS

DBA_INVALID_OBJECTS describes all invalid objects in the database. You can use this view to identify invalid objects before and after a database upgrade.

## Columns

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| OWNER | VARCHAR2(128) | Owner of the object |
| OBJECT_NAME | VARCHAR2(128) | Name of the object |
| SUBOBJECT_NAME | VARCHAR2(128) | Name of the subobject (for example, partition) |
| OBJECT_ID | NUMBER | Dictionary object number of the object. |
| DATA_OBJECT_ID | NUMBER | Dictionary object number of the segment that contains the object. Note: OBJECT_ID and DATA_OBJECT_ID display data dictionary metadata. Do not confuse these numbers with the unique 16-byte object identifier ( object ID ) that Oracle Database assigns to row objects in object tables in the system. |
| OBJECT_TYPE | VARCHAR2(23) | Type of the object (such as TABLE , INDEX ). The current version of the type is shown only if it is invalid. In other words, if prior versions of the type are invalid but the most recent version of the type is valid, it will not be in this list. |
| CREATED | DATE | Timestamp for the creation of the object |
| LAST_DDL_TIME | DATE | Timestamp for the last modification of the object and dependent objects resulting from a DDL statement (including grants and revokes) |
| TIMESTAMP | VARCHAR2(19) | Timestamp for the specification of the object (character data) |
| STATUS | VARCHAR2(7) | Status of the object: VALID INVALID N/A |
| TEMPORARY | VARCHAR2(1) | Indicates whether the object is temporary (the current session can see only data that it placed in this object itself) ( Y ) or not ( N ) |
| GENERATED | VARCHAR2(1) | Indicates whether the name of this object was system-generated ( Y ) or not ( N ) |
| SECONDARY | VARCHAR2(1) | Indicates whether this is a secondary object created by the ODCIIndexCreate method of the Oracle Data Cartridge ( Y ) or not ( N ) |
| NAMESPACE | NUMBER | Namespace for the object |
| EDITION_NAME | VARCHAR2(128) | Name of the edition in which the object is actual |
| SHARING | VARCHAR2(18) | Values: DATA LINK - If the object is data-linked or a data link to an object in the root METADATA LINK - If the object is metadata-linked or a metadata link to an object in the root EXTENDED DATA LINK - If the object is extended-data-linked or an extended data link to an object in the root NONE - If none of the above applies |
| EDITIONABLE | VARCHAR2(1) | Values: Y - For objects marked EDITIONABLE N - For objects marked NONEDITIONABLE NULL - For objects whose type is not editionable in the database |
| ORACLE_MAINTAINED | VARCHAR2(1) | Denotes whether the object was created, and is maintained, by Oracle-supplied scripts (such as catalog.sql or catproc.sql). An object for which this column has the value Y must not be changed in any way except by running an Oracle-supplied script. |
| APPLICATION | VARCHAR2(1) | Indicates whether the object is an Application common object ( Y ) or not ( N ) |
| DEFAULT_COLLATION | VARCHAR2(100) | Default collation for the object |
| DUPLICATED | VARCHAR2(1) | Indicates whether this object is duplicated on this shard ( Y ) or not ( N ) |
| SHARDED | VARCHAR2(1) | Indicates whether this object is sharded ( Y ) or not ( N ) |
| CREATED_APPID | NUMBER | ID of the Application that created the object |
| CREATED_VSNID | NUMBER | ID of the Application Version that created the object |
| MODIFIED_APPID | NUMBER | ID of the Application that last modified the object |
| MODIFIED_VSNID | NUMBER | ID of the Application Version that last modified the object |
