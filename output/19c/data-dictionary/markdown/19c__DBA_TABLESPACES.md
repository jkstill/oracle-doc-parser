# DBA_TABLESPACES

DBA_TABLESPACES describes all tablespaces in the database.

## Columns

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| TABLESPACE_NAME | VARCHAR2(30) | Name of the tablespace |
| BLOCK_SIZE | NUMBER | Tablespace block size (in bytes) |
| INITIAL_EXTENT | NUMBER | Default initial extent size (in bytes) |
| NEXT_EXTENT | NUMBER | Default incremental extent size (in bytes) |
| MIN_EXTENTS | NUMBER | Default minimum number of extents |
| MAX_EXTENTS | NUMBER | Default maximum number of extents |
| MAX_SIZE | NUMBER | Default maximum size of segments (in Oracle blocks) |
| PCT_INCREASE | NUMBER | Default percent increase for extent size |
| MIN_EXTLEN | NUMBER | Minimum extent size for this tablespace (in bytes) |
| STATUS | VARCHAR2(9) | Tablespace status: ONLINE OFFLINE READ ONLY |
| CONTENTS | VARCHAR2(9) | Tablespace contents: UNDO LOST WRITE PROTECTION PERMANENT TEMPORARY |
| LOGGING | VARCHAR2(9) | Default logging attribute: LOGGING NOLOGGING |
| FORCE_LOGGING | VARCHAR2(3) | Indicates whether the tablespace is under force logging mode ( YES ) or not ( NO ) |
| EXTENT_MANAGEMENT | VARCHAR2(10) | Indicates whether the extents in the tablespace are dictionary managed ( DICTIONARY ) or locally managed ( LOCAL ) |
| ALLOCATION_TYPE | VARCHAR2(9) | Type of extent allocation in effect for the tablespace: SYSTEM UNIFORM USER |
| PLUGGED_IN | VARCHAR2(3) | Indicates whether the tablespace is plugged in ( YES ) or not ( NO ) |
| SEGMENT_SPACE_MANAGEMENT | VARCHAR2(6) | Indicates whether the free and used segment space in the tablespace is managed using free lists ( MANUAL ) or bitmaps ( AUTO ) |
| DEF_TAB_COMPRESSION | VARCHAR2(8) | Indicates whether default table compression is enabled ( ENABLED ) or not ( DISABLED ) Note: Enabling default table compression indicates that all tables in the tablespace will be created with table compression enabled unless otherwise specified. |
| RETENTION | VARCHAR2(11) | Undo tablespace retention: GUARANTEE - Tablespace is an undo tablespace with RETENTION specified as GUARANTEE A RETENTION value of GUARANTEE indicates that unexpired undo in all undo segments in the undo tablespace should be retained even if it means that forward going operations that need to generate undo in those segments fail. NOGUARANTEE - Tablespace is an undo tablespace with RETENTION specified as NOGUARANTEE NOT APPLY - Tablespace is not an undo tablespace |
| BIGFILE | VARCHAR2(3) | Indicates whether the tablespace is a bigfile tablespace ( YES ) or a smallfile tablespace ( NO ) |
| PREDICATE_EVALUATION | VARCHAR2(7) | Indicates whether predicates are evaluated by host ( HOST ) or by storage ( STORAGE ) |
| ENCRYPTED | VARCHAR2(3) | Indicates whether the tablespace is encrypted ( YES ) or not ( NO ) |
| COMPRESS_FOR | VARCHAR2(30) | Default compression for what kind of operations: BASIC ADVANCED QUERY LOW QUERY HIGH ARCHIVE LOW ARCHIVE HIGH NULL The QUERY LOW , QUERY HIGH , ARCHIVE LOW , and ARCHIVE HIGH values are associated with Hybrid Columnar Compression, a feature of the Enterprise Edition of Oracle Database that is dependent on the underlying storage system. See Oracle Database Concepts for more information. |
| DEF_INMEMORY | VARCHAR2(8) | Indicates whether the In-Memory Column Store (IM column store) is by default enabled ( ENABLED ) or disabled ( DISABLED ) for tables in this tablespace |
| DEF_INMEMORY_PRIORITY | VARCHAR2(8) | Indicates the default priority for In-Memory Column Store (IM column store) population for this tablespace. Possible values: LOW MEDIUM HIGH CRITICAL NONE NULL |
| DEF_INMEMORY_DISTRIBUTE | VARCHAR2(15) | Indicates how the IM column store is distributed by default for this tablespace in an Oracle Real Application Clusters (Oracle RACE) environment: AUTO BY ROWID RANGE BY PARTITION BY SUBPARTITION |
| DEF_INMEMORY_COMPRESSION | VARCHAR2(17) | Indicates the default compression level for the IM column store for this tablespace: NO MEMCOMPRESS FOR DML FOR QUERY [ LOW | HIGH ] FOR CAPACITY [ LOW | HIGH ] NULL |
| DEF_INMEMORY_DUPLICATE | VARCHAR2(13) | Indicates the duplicate setting for the IM column store in an Oracle RAC environment: NO DUPLICATE DUPLICATE DUPLICATE ALL |
| SHARED | VARCHAR2(12) | Tablespace type: SHARED : For shared tablespace LOCAL_ON_LEAF : For local temporary tablespace for leaf (read-only) instances LOCAL_ON_ALL : For local temporary tablespace for all instance types |
| DEF_INDEX_COMPRESSION | VARCHAR2(8) | Indicates whether default index compression is enabled ( ENABLED ) or not ( DISABLED ) Note: Enabling default index compression indicates that all indexes in the tablespace will be created with index compression enabled unless otherwise specified. |
| INDEX_COMPRESS_FOR | VARCHAR2(13) | Valid values are: ADVANCED LOW ADVANCED HIGH NULL No other values are allowed. |
| DEF_CELLMEMORY | VARCHAR2(14) | This specifies the default value for the CELLMEMORY attribute that tables created in the tablespace will inherit unless the behavior is overridden explicitly This column is intended for use with Oracle Exadata. |
| DEF_INMEMORY_SERVICE | VARCHAR2(12) | Indicates how the IM column store is populated on various instances by default for this tablespace. The possible values are: DEFAULT : Data is populated on all instances specified with the PARALLEL_INSTANCE_GROUP initialization parameter. If that parameter is not set, then the data is populated on all instances. This is the default. NONE : Data is not populated on any instance. ALL : Data is populated on all instances, regardless of the value of the PARALLEL_INSTANCE_GROUP initialization parameter. USER_DEFINED : Data is populated only on the instances on which the user-specified service is active. The service name corresponding to this is stored in the DEF_INMEMORY_SERVICE_NAME column. |
| DEF_INMEMORY_SERVICE_NAME | VARCHAR2(1000) | Indicates the service name for the service on which the IM column store should be populated by default for this tablespace. This column has a value only when the corresponding DEF_INMEMORY_SERVICE is USER_DEFINED . In all other cases, this column is null. |
| LOST_WRITE_PROTECT | VARCHAR2(7) | The lost write protection setting for the tablespace. Possible values: ENABLED : Indicates that lost write data is being collected OFF : Indicates that lost write data is not being collected SUSPEND : Indicates that lost write data is not currently being collected, but it can be enabled at a later date. The lost write data collected when the file was ENABLED remains in the lost write database, but it is not being checked or updated. If lost write protection is enabled for a tablespace, it is enabled for all data files for that tablespace, including data files added later. If lost write protection is enabled for a single data file, it does not have to be enabled for another data file in the same tablespace. You can check the lost write protection status for a data file by querying the LOST_WRITE_PROTECT column in the DBA_DATA_FILES view. |
| CHUNK_TABLESPACE | VARCHAR2(1) | Indicates whether this is a chunk tablespace ( Y ) or not ( N ) |
