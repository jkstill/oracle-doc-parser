# DBA_HIST_PROCESS_MEM_SUMMARY

DBA_HIST_PROCESS_MEM_SUMMARY displays historical information about dynamic PGA memory usage by named component categories for each process.

## Columns

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| SNAP_ID | NUMBER | Unique snapshot ID |
| DBID | NUMBER | Database ID for the snapshot |
| INSTANCE_NUMBER | NUMBER | Instance number for the snapshot |
| CATEGORY | VARCHAR2(15) | Category name. Categories include "SQL", "PL/SQL", "OLAP" and "JAVA". Special categories are "Freeable" and "Other". Freeable memory has been allocated to the process by the operating system, but has not been allocated to a category. "Other" memory has been allocated to a category, but not to one of the named categories |
| IS_INSTANCE_WIDE | NUMBER | This column shows whether the process memory detail is for only this container or for the whole instance. If the value is 1 , the detail is for the whole instance. Any other value is the container ID for the container to which the detail pertains, as seen in the CON_ID column. |
| NUM_PROCESSES | NUMBER | Number of processes |
| NON_ZERO_ALLOCS | NUMBER | Number of processes with nonzero allocations |
| USED_TOTAL | NUMBER | Bytes of PGA memory used by the process for the category |
| ALLOCATED_TOTAL | NUMBER | Total number of bytes of PGA memory allocated by the process for the category. |
| ALLOCATED_AVG | NUMBER | Average number of bytes of PGA memory allocated by the process for the category |
| ALLOCATED_STDDEV | NUMBER | Standard deviation of the number of bytes of PGA memory allocated by the process for the category |
| ALLOCATED_MAX | NUMBER | Maximum bytes of PGA memory ever allocated by the process for the category |
| MAX_ALLOCATED_MAX | NUMBER | Maximum bytes of PGA memory that can be allocated by the process for the category |
| CON_DBID | NUMBER | The database ID of the PDB for the sampled session |
| CON_ID | NUMBER | The ID of the container that CON_DBID identifies. Possible values include: 0 : This value is used for rows containing data that pertain to the entire CDB. This value is also used for rows in non-CDBs. 1 : This value is used for rows containing data that pertain to only the root n : Where n is the applicable container ID for the rows containing data |
