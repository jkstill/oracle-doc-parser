## Columns

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| INST_ID | NUMBER | Identifier for the instance |
| CON_ID | NUMBER | The ID of the container to which the data pertains. Possible values include: 0 : This value is used for rows containing data that pertain to the entire CDB. This value is also used for rows in non-CDBs. 1 : This value is used for rows containing data that pertain to only the root n : Where n is the applicable container ID for the rows containing data |
| SERVICE_NAME | VARCHAR2(64) | Service name of the session |
| FAILOVER_TYPE | VARCHAR2(16) | Indicates the FAILOVER_TYPE service setting for the session. Possible values: AUTO - Transparent Application Continuity (TAC) was enabled for the session TRANSACTION - Application Continuity (AC) was enabled for the session NONE - Failover was disabled for the session |
| FAILOVER_RESTORE | VARCHAR2(16) | Indicates the FAILOVER_RESTORE service setting for the session. Possible values: AUTO - Transparent Application Continuity LEVEL1 - Application Continuity NONE - Session state was not restored at failover |
| RESET_STATE | VARCHAR2(16) | Indicates the RESET_STATE service setting for the session. Possible values: LEVEL1 - The session state was cleaned at the end of a request NONE - The session state was not cleaned at the end of a request |

NOT ENABLING - The event describes why the database could not reenable protection after protection was disabled. Refer to the ERROR_CODE column for more information. REPLAY FAILED - The event describes why the session did not fail over. This event only occurs if Application Continuity could not fail over. Refer to the ERROR_CODE column for more information. |
| ERROR_CODE | NUMBER | If an error occurred, this column displays the error code: ORA- number . Otherwise, the value of this column is 0 . |
| FREQUENCY | NUMBER | Number of times the event occurred during the workload run |
