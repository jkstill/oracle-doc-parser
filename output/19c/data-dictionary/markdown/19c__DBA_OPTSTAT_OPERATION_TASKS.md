| JOB_NAME | VARCHAR2(50) | Name of the scheduler job that executes this task (for example, when concurrency is on) |
| ESTIMATED_COST | NUMBER | Estimated cost of the task (measured as elapsed time in seconds). This column is populated only when concurrency is on. |
| BATCHING_COEFF | NUMBER | For internal use only |
| ACTIONS | NUMBER | For internal use only |
