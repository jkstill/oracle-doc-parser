# DBA_HIST_SQLSTAT

DBA_HIST_SQLSTAT displays historical information about SQL statistics.

## Columns

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| SNAP_ID | NUMBER | Unique snapshot ID |
| DBID | NUMBER | Database ID for the snapshot |
| INSTANCE_NUMBER | NUMBER | Instance number for the snapshot |
| SQL_ID | VARCHAR2(13) | SQL identifier of the parent cursor in the library cache |
| PLAN_HASH_VALUE | NUMBER | Numerical representation of the SQL plan for the cursor. Comparing one PLAN_HASH_VALUE to another easily identifies whether or not two plans are the same (rather than comparing the two plans line by line). |
| OPTIMIZER_COST | NUMBER | Cost of the query given by the optimizer |
| OPTIMIZER_MODE | VARCHAR2(10) | Mode under which the SQL statement is executed |
| OPTIMIZER_ENV_HASH_VALUE | NUMBER | Hash Value for the optimizer environment |
| SHARABLE_MEM | NUMBER | Amount of shared memory used by the child cursor (in bytes) |
| LOADED_VERSIONS | NUMBER | Indicates whether the context heap is loaded ( 1 ) or not ( 0 ) |
| VERSION_COUNT | NUMBER | Number of children associated with the cursor |
| MODULE | VARCHAR2(64) | Contains the name of the module that was executing at the time that the SQL statement was first parsed, which is set by calling DBMS_APPLICATION_INFO.SET_MODULE |
| ACTION | VARCHAR2(64) | Contains the name of the action that was executing at the time that the SQL statement was first parsed, which is set by calling DBMS_APPLICATION_INFO.SET_ACTION |
| SQL_PROFILE | VARCHAR2(64) | Name of the applied SQL Profile |
| FORCE_MATCHING_SIGNATURE | NUMBER | The signature used when the CURSOR_SHARING parameter is set to FORCE |
| PARSING_SCHEMA_ID | NUMBER | Schema ID that was used to originally build the child cursor |
| PARSING_SCHEMA_NAME | VARCHAR2(128) | Schema name that was used to originally build the child cursor |
| PARSING_USER_ID | NUMBER | User ID that was used to originally build the child cursor |

| FETCHES_DELTA | NUMBER | Delta number of fetches associated with the SQL statement |
| END_OF_FETCH_COUNT_TOTAL | NUMBER | Cumulative number of times this cursor was fully executed since the cursor was brought into the library cache. The value of this statistic is not incremented when the cursor is partially executed, either because it failed during the execution or because only the first few rows produced by this cursor are fetched before the cursor is closed or re-executed. By definition, the value of the END_OF_FETCH_COUNT column should be less or equal to the value of the EXECUTIONS column. |
| END_OF_FETCH_COUNT_DELTA | NUMBER | Delta number of times this cursor was fully executed since the cursor was brought into the library cache. The value of this statistic is not incremented when the cursor is partially executed, either because it failed during the execution or because only the first few rows produced by this cursor are fetched before the cursor is closed or re-executed. |

## Usage Notes

Previous Next JavaScript must be enabled to correctly display this content This view captures the top SQL statements based on a set of criteria and captures the statistics information from V$SQL . The total value is the value of the statistics since instance startup. The delta value is the value of the statistics from the BEGIN_INTERVAL_TIME to the END_INTERVAL_TIME in the DBA_HIST_SNAPSHOT view. This view is used with the DBA_HIST_OPTIMIZER_ENV , DBA_HIST_SQLTEXT , and DBA_HIST_SQL_PLAN views to provide a complete picture of historical SQL statistics.
