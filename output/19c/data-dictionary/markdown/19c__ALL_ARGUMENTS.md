| PACKAGE_NAME | VARCHAR2(128) | Name of the package |

| POSITION | NUMBER | This column holds the position of this item in the argument list, or 0 for a function return value. |
| SEQUENCE | NUMBER | Defines the sequential order of the argument. Argument sequence starts from 1. Return type comes first, and each argument will follow. |
| DATA_LEVEL | NUMBER | Nesting depth of the argument for composite types Note: Starting with Oracle Database 18c, the value of this columns is always 0 , because this view displays only one row for each argument. This view no longer displays multiple rows for composite type arguments. |
| DATA_TYPE | VARCHAR2(30) | Datatype of the argument |
| DEFAULTED | VARCHAR2(1) | Specifies whether or not the argument is defaulted |
| DEFAULT_VALUE | LONG | Reserved for future use |
| DEFAULT_LENGTH | NUMBER | Reserved for future use |
| IN_OUT | VARCHAR2(9) | Direction of the argument: IN OUT IN/OUT |
| DATA_LENGTH | NUMBER | Length of the column (in bytes) |
| DATA_PRECISION | NUMBER | Length in decimal digits ( NUMBER ) or binary digits ( FLOAT ) |
| DATA_SCALE | NUMBER | Digits to the right of the decimal point in a number |
| RADIX | NUMBER | Argument radix for a number |
| CHARACTER_SET_NAME | VARCHAR2(44) | Character set name for the argument |
| TYPE_OWNER | VARCHAR2(128) | Owner of the type of the argument |
| TYPE_NAME | VARCHAR2(128) | Name of the type of the argument. If the type is a package local type (that is, it is declared in a package specification), then this column displays the name of the package. |
| TYPE_SUBNAME | VARCHAR2(128) | Relevant only for package local types. Displays the name of the type declared in the package identified in the TYPE_NAME column. |
| TYPE_LINK | VARCHAR2(128) | Relevant only for package local types when the package identified in the TYPE_NAME column is a remote package. This column displays the database link used to refer to the remote package. |
| TYPE_OBJECT_TYPE | VARCHAR2(7) | Displays the type of the type described by the TYPE_OWNER , TYPE_NAME , and TYPE_SUBNAME columns. Possible values are: TABLE VIEW PACKAGE TYPE |
| PLS_TYPE | VARCHAR2(128) | For numeric arguments, the name of the PL/SQL type of the argument. Null otherwise. |
| CHAR_LENGTH | NUMBER | Character limit for string datatypes |
| CHAR_USED | VARCHAR2(1) | Indicates whether the byte limit ( B ) or char limit ( C ) is official for the string |
| ORIGIN_CON_ID | VARCHAR2(256) | The ID of the container where the data originates. Possible values include: 0 : This value is used for rows in non-CDBs. This value is not used for CDBs. n : This value is used for rows containing data that originate in the container with container ID n ( n = 1 if the row originates in root) |

## Usage Notes

Previous Next JavaScript must be enabled to correctly display this content Note: The following changes have been made to this view: Starting with Oracle Database 12c release 1 (12.1.0.2), this view omits procedures with no arguments. Prior to Oracle Database 12c release 1 (12.1.0.2), a procedure with no arguments was presented as a single row in this view. Starting with Oracle Database 18c, this view displays only one row for an argument that is a composite type. Prior to Oracle Database 18c, this view displayed multiple rows for composite types. To obtain information about composite type arguments, use the value of the TYPE_NAME column in this view to query the ALL_PLSQL_TYPES , ALL_PLSQL_TYPE_ATTRS , and ALL_PLSQL_COLL_TYPES views, which fully describe composite types.
