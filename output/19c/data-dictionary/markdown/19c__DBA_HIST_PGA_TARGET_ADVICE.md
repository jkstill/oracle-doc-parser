# DBA_HIST_PGA_TARGET_ADVICE

DBA_HIST_PGA_TARGET_ADVICE displays historical predictions of how the cache hit percentage and over allocation count statistics displayed by the V$PGASTAT performance view would be impacted if the value of the PGA_AGGREGATE_TARGET parameter is changed.

## Columns

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| SNAP_ID | NUMBER | Unique snapshot ID |
| DBID | NUMBER | Database ID for the snapshot |
| INSTANCE_NUMBER | NUMBER | Instance number for the snapshot |
| PGA_TARGET_FOR_ESTIMATE | NUMBER | Value of PGA_AGGREGATE_TARGET for the prediction (in bytes) |
| PGA_TARGET_FACTOR | NUMBER | PGA_TARGET_FOR_ESTIMATE / the current value of the PGA_AGGREGATE_TARGET parameter |
| ADVICE_STATUS | VARCHAR2(3) | Indicates whether the advice is enabled ( ON ) or disabled ( OFF ) depending on the value of the STATISTICS_LEVEL parameter |
| BYTES_PROCESSED | NUMBER | Total bytes processed by all the work areas considered by this advice (in bytes) |
| ESTD_TIME | NUMBER | Time (in seconds) required to process the bytes |
| ESTD_EXTRA_BYTES_RW | NUMBER | Estimated number of extra bytes which would be read or written if PGA_AGGREGATE_TARGET was set to the value of the PGA_TARGET_FOR_ESTIMATE column. This number is derived from the estimated number and size of work areas which would run in one-pass (or multi-pass) for that value of PGA_AGGREGATE_TARGET . |
| ESTD_PGA_CACHE_HIT_PERCENTAGE | NUMBER | Estimated value of the cache hit percentage statistic when PGA_AGGREGATE_TARGET equals PGA_TARGET_FOR_ESTIMATE . This column is derived from the above two columns and is equal to BYTES_PROCESSED / ( BYTES_PROCESSED + ESTD_EXTRA_BYTES_RW ) |
| ESTD_OVERALLOC_COUNT | NUMBER | Estimated number of PGA memory over-allocations if the value of PGA_AGGREGATE_TARGET is set to PGA_TARGET_FOR_ESTIMATE . A nonzero value means that PGA_TARGET_FOR_ESTIMATE is not large enough to run the work area workload. Hence, PGA_AGGREGATE_TARGET should not be set to PGA_TARGET_FOR_ESTIMATE since Oracle will not be able to honor that target. |
| CON_DBID | NUMBER | The database ID of the PDB for the sampled session |
| CON_ID | NUMBER | The ID of the container that CON_DBID identifies. Possible values include: 0 : This value is used for rows containing data that pertain to the entire CDB. This value is also used for rows in non-CDBs. 1 : This value is used for rows containing data that pertain to only the root n : Where n is the applicable container ID for the rows containing data |
