# DBA_HIST_RSRC_PDB_METRIC

DBA_HIST_RSRC_PDB_METRIC displays information about historical Resource Manager metrics for the past hour by PDB.

## Columns

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| SNAP_ID | NUMBER | Unique snapshot ID |
| DBID | NUMBER | Database ID for the snapshot |
| INSTANCE_NUMBER | NUMBER | Instance number for the snapshot |
| BEGIN_TIME | TIMESTAMP(3) | Begin time of the interval |
| END_TIME | TIMESTAMP(3) | End time of the interval |
| INTSIZE_CSEC | NUMBER | Interval size (in hundredths of a second) |
| SEQUENCE# | NUMBER | A sequential counter that uniquely describes the V$RSRC_PLAN_HISTORY entry to which these PDB statistics apply. When the instance is restarted, this value is reset to zero. |
| CPU_CONSUMED_TIME | NUMBER | Cumulative amount of CPU time consumed by all sessions in the PDB, in milliseconds |
| CPU_WAIT_TIME | NUMBER | Cumulative amount of time that sessions waited for CPU because of resource management, in milliseconds. This does not include waits due to latch or enqueue contention, I/O waits, and so on. When CPU resources are not being actively managed, this value is set to zero. |
| AVG_RUNNING_SESSIONS | NUMBER | Average number of sessions in the PDB that are currently running |
| AVG_WAITING_SESSIONS | NUMBER | Average number of sessions in the PDB that are waiting for CPU due to resource management. When CPU resources are not being actively managed, this value is set to zero. |
| AVG_CPU_UTILIZATION | NUMBER | Average percentage of CPU consumed by the PDB, with respect to the total number of CPUs in the system |
| IOPS | NUMBER | I/O operations per second during the previous minute for this PDB |
| IOMBPS | NUMBER | I/O megabytes per second during the previous minute for this PDB |
| IOPS_THROTTLE_EXEMPT | NUMBER | Indicates how much of the I/O per second in the current PDB was exempted from throttling. For example, if the value in the IOPS column is 20 I/Os and the value in the IOPS_THROTTLE_EXEMPT column is 5 I/Os, then 5 I/Os of the 20 I/Os in that second were exempted from throttling. I/O throttling is defined by the MAX_IOPS database initialization parameter. |
| IOMBPS_THROTTLE_EXEMPT | NUMBER | Indicates how many megabytes of I/O executed per second in the current PDB were exempted from throttling. For example, if the value in the IOMBPS column is 200 megabytes and the value in the IOMBPS_THROTTLE_EXEMPT column is 50 megabytes, then 50 megabytes of the 200 megabytes were exempt from throttling. I/O megabytes per second throttling is defined by the MAX_MBPS database initialization parameter. |
| AVG_IO_THROTTLE | NUMBER | Average throttle time per I/O operation in milliseconds during the previous minute for this PDB |
| AVG_ACTIVE_PARALLEL_STMTS | NUMBER | The average number of parallel statements that were running during the 1-minute metric window |
| AVG_QUEUED_PARALLEL_STMTS | NUMBER | The average number of parallel statements that were queued during the 1-minute metric window |
| AVG_ACTIVE_PARALLEL_SERVERS | NUMBER | The average number of parallel servers that were actively running as part of a parallel statement during the 1-minute metric window |
| AVG_QUEUED_PARALLEL_SERVERS | NUMBER | The average number of parallel servers that were requested by queued parallel statements during the 1-minute metric window |
| SGA_BYTES | NUMBER | The current SGA usage for this PDB in bytes |
| BUFFER_CACHE_BYTES | NUMBER | The current usage of the buffer cache by this PDB in bytes |
| SHARED_POOL_BYTES | NUMBER | The current usage of the shared pool by this PDB in bytes |
| PGA_BYTES | NUMBER | The current PGA usage for this PDB in bytes |
| PLAN_ID | NUMBER | Resource Manager plan identifier |
| CON_DBID | NUMBER | The database ID of the PDB for the sampled session |
| CON_ID | NUMBER | The ID of the container that CON_DBID identifies. Possible values include: 0 : This value is used for rows containing data that pertain to the entire CDB. This value is also used for rows in non-CDBs. 1 : This value is used for rows containing data that pertain to only the root n : Where n is the applicable container ID for the rows containing data |
