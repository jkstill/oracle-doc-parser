## Columns

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| OS_USERNAME | VARCHAR2(255) | Operating system login username of the user whose actions were audited |
| USERNAME | VARCHAR2(128) | Name (not ID number) of the user whose actions were audited |
| USERHOST | VARCHAR2(128) | Client host machine name |
| TERMINAL | VARCHAR2(255) | Identifier of the user's terminal |
| TIMESTAMP | DATE | Date and time of the creation of the audit trail entry (date and time of user login for entries created by AUDIT SESSION ) in the local database session time zone |
| OWNER | VARCHAR2(128) | Creator of the object affected by the action |
| OBJ_NAME | VARCHAR2(128) | Name of the object affected by the action |
| ACTION | NUMBER | Numeric action type code. The corresponding name of the action type is in the ACTION_NAME column. |
| ACTION_NAME | VARCHAR2(28) | Name of the action type corresponding to the numeric code in the ACTION column |
| NEW_OWNER | VARCHAR2(128) | Owner of the object named in the NEW_NAME column |
| NEW_NAME | VARCHAR2(128) | New name of the object after a RENAME or the name of the underlying object |
| OBJ_PRIVILEGE | VARCHAR2(32) | Object privileges granted or revoked by a GRANT or REVOKE statement. The value of this column is a 32-character string of Y and dash ( - ) characters. Each character corresponds to a numbered privilege in the following list. The left-most character corresponds to privilege 0, the next character corresponds to privilege 1, and so on. The right-most character corresponds to privilege 31. 0 - ALTER 1 - AUDIT 2 - COMMENT 3 - DELETE 4 - GRANT 5 - INDEX 6 - INSERT 7 - LOCK 8 - CREATE 9 - SELECT 10 - UPDATE 11 - REFERENCES 12 - EXECUTE 13 - VIEW 14 - DROP 15 - ANALYZE 16 - CREATE 17 - READ 18 - WRITE 19 - KEEP SEQUENCE 20 - ENQUEUE 21 - DEQUEUE 22 - UNDER 23 - ON COMMIT 24 - REWRITE 25 - UPSERT 26 - DEBUG 27 - FLASHBACK 28 - MERGE 29 - USE 30 - FLASHBACK ARCHIVE 31 - DIRECTORY EXECUTE A Y indicates that the privilege was granted or revoked by the statement. A dash indicates that the privilege was not affected by the statement. For example, the following value indicates that the MERGE privilege was granted or revoked by the statement: ----------------------------Y--- |
| SYS_PRIVILEGE | VARCHAR2(40) | System privileges granted or revoked by a GRANT or REVOKE statement |
| ADMIN_OPTION | VARCHAR2(1) | Indicates whether the role or system privilege was granted with the ADMIN option |
| GRANTEE | VARCHAR2(128) | Name of the grantee specified in a GRANT or REVOKE statement |
| AUDIT_OPTION | VARCHAR2(40) | Auditing option set with the AUDIT statement |
| SES_ACTIONS | VARCHAR2(19) | Session summary (a string of 16 characters, one for each action type in the order ALTER , AUDIT , COMMENT , DELETE , GRANT , INDEX , INSERT , LOCK , RENAME , SELECT , UPDATE , REFERENCES , and EXECUTE ). Positions 14, 15, and 16 are reserved for future use. The characters are: - - None S - Success F - Failure B - Both |
| LOGOFF_TIME | DATE | Date and time of user log off |
| LOGOFF_LREAD | NUMBER | Logical reads for the session |
| LOGOFF_PREAD | NUMBER | Physical reads for the session |
| LOGOFF_LWRITE | NUMBER | Logical writes for the session |
| LOGOFF_DLOCK | VARCHAR2(40) | Deadlocks detected during the session |
| COMMENT_TEXT | VARCHAR2(4000) | Text comment on the audit trail entry, providing more information about the statement audited Also indicates how the user or remote call was authenticated. The method can be one of the following: DATABASE - Authentication was done by password NETWORK - Authentication was done by Oracle Net Services or strong authentication PROXY - Client was authenticated by another user; the name of the proxy user follows the method type When an object is accessed remotely over a database link, the COMMENT_TEXT column also captures the information about the database link. For example: DBLINK_INFO: (SOURCE_GLOBAL_NAME=view02.regress.rdbms.dev.us.example.com, DBLINK_NAME=VIEW05_LINK.REGRESS.RDBMS.DEV.US.EXAMPLE.COM, SOURCE_AUDIT_SESSIONID=250805) |
| SESSIONID | NUMBER | Numeric ID for each Oracle session. Each user session gets a unique session ID. |
| ENTRYID | NUMBER | Numeric ID for each audit trail entry in the session. The entry ID is an index of a session's audit entries that starts at 1 and increases to the number of entries that are written. |
| STATEMENTID | NUMBER | n th statement in the user session. The first SQL statement gets a value of 1 and the value is incremented for each subsequent SQL statement. Note that one SQL statement can create more than one audit trail entry (for example, when more than one object is audited from the same SQL statement), and in this case the statement ID remains the same for that statement and the entry ID increases for each audit trail entry created by the statement. |
| RETURNCODE | NUMBER | Oracle error code generated by the action. Some useful values: 0 - Action succeeded 2004 - Security violation |
| PRIV_USED | VARCHAR2(40) | System privilege used to execute the action |
| CLIENT_ID | VARCHAR2(128) | Client identifier in each Oracle session |
| ECONTEXT_ID | VARCHAR2(64) | Application execution context identifier |
| SESSION_CPU | NUMBER | Amount of CPU time used by each Oracle session (in centiseconds) |
| EXTENDED_TIMESTAMP | TIMESTAMP(6) WITH TIME ZONE | Timestamp of the creation of the audit trail entry (timestamp of user login for entries created by AUDIT SESSION ) in UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) time zone |
| PROXY_SESSIONID | NUMBER | Proxy session serial number, if an enterprise user has logged in through the proxy mechanism |
| GLOBAL_UID | VARCHAR2(32) | Global user identifier for the user, if the user has logged in as an enterprise user |
| INSTANCE_NUMBER | NUMBER | Instance number as specified by the INSTANCE_NUMBER initialization parameter |
| OS_PROCESS | VARCHAR2(16) | Operating System process identifier of the Oracle process |
| TRANSACTIONID | RAW(8) | Transaction identifier of the transaction in which the object is accessed or modified |
| SCN | NUMBER | System change number (SCN) of the creation of the audit trail entry |
| SQL_BIND | NVARCHAR2(2000) | Bind variable data of the query |
| SQL_TEXT | NVARCHAR2(2000) | SQL text of the query |
| OBJ_EDITION_NAME | VARCHAR2(128) | Name of the edition containing the audited object |
| DBID | NUMBER | Database identifier of the audited database |
| RLS_INFO | CLOB | Stores virtual private database (VPD) policy names and predicates separated by delimiter. To format the output into individual rows, use the DBMS_AUDIT_UTIL.DECODE_RLS_INFO_ATRAIL_STD function. |
| CURRENT_USER | VARCHAR2(128) | Effective user for the statement execution |
