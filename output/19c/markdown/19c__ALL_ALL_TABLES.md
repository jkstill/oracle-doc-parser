| INMEMORY_SERVICE | VARCHAR2(12) | Indicates how the IM column store is populated on various instances.

ALL : Data is populated on all instances, regardless of the value of the PARALLEL_INSTANCE_GROUP initialization parameter. USER_DEFINED : Data is populated only on the instances on which the user-specified service is active. The service name corresponding to this is stored in the INMEMORY_SERVICE_NAME column. |
| INMEMORY_SERVICE_NAME | VARCHAR2(1000) | Indicates the service name for the service on which the IM column store should be populated. This column has a value only when the corresponding INMEMORY_SERVICE is USER_DEFINED . In all other cases, this column is null. |
