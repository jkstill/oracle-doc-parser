| INST_ID | NUMBER | Identifier for the instance in which the trace record was generated |
| CON_ID | NUMBER | The ID of the container to which the data pertains. Possible values include: 0 : This value is used for rows containing data that pertain to the entire CDB. This value is also used for rows in non-CDBs. 1 : This value is used for rows containing data that pertain to only the root n : Where n is the applicable container ID for the rows containing data |
| TIMESTAMP | TIMESTAMP(3) WITH TIME ZONE | Time at which the event occurred |
| SESSION_ID | NUMBER | ID of the session that generated the trace record |
| SERIAL# | NUMBER | Serial number of the session that generated the trace record |
| SERVICE_NAME | VARCHAR2(64) | Service name of the session that generated the trace record |

NOT ENABLING - The event describes why the database could not reenable protection after protection was disabled. Refer to the ERROR_CODE column for more information. REPLAY FAILED - The event describes why the session did not fail over. This event only occurs if Application Continuity could not fail over. Refer to the ERROR_CODE column for more information. |

## Usage Notes

Each row in this view represents one trace record for an event. You can use this view in conjunction with the DBA_ACCHK_STATISTICS view. Join the SESSION_ID and SERIAL# columns in this view with the SESSION_ID and SERIAL# columns in DBA_ACCHK_STATISTICS to view Application Continuity protection statistics for a particular session. The ACCHK_READ role allows users with no administrative privileges to query this view.
