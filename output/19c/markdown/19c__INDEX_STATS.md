# INDEX_STATS

INDEX_STATS stores information from the last ANALYZE INDEX ... VALIDATE STRUCTURE statement.

## Columns

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| HEIGHT | NUMBER | Height of the B-Tree |
| BLOCKS | NUMBER | Blocks allocated to the segment |
| NAME | VARCHAR2(128) | Name of the index |
| PARTITION_NAME | VARCHAR2(128) | Name of the partition of the index which was analyzed. If the index is not partitioned, NULL is returned. |
| LF_ROWS | NUMBER | Number of leaf rows (values in the index) |
| LF_BLKS | NUMBER | Number of leaf blocks in the B-Tree |
| LF_ROWS_LEN | NUMBER | Sum of the lengths of all the leaf rows |
| LF_BLK_LEN | NUMBER | Usable space in a leaf block |
| BR_ROWS | NUMBER | Number of branch rows in the B-Tree |
| BR_BLKS | NUMBER | Number of branch blocks in the B-Tree |
| BR_ROWS_LEN | NUMBER | Sum of the lengths of all the branch blocks in the B-Tree |
| BR_BLK_LEN | NUMBER | Usable space in a branch block |
| DEL_LF_ROWS | NUMBER | Number of deleted leaf rows in the index |
| DEL_LF_ROWS_LEN | NUMBER | Total length of all deleted rows in the index |
| DISTINCT_KEYS | NUMBER | Number of distinct keys in the index (may include rows that have been deleted) |
| MOST_REPEATED_KEY | NUMBER | How many times the most repeated key is repeated (may include rows that have been deleted) |
| BTREE_SPACE | NUMBER | Total space currently allocated in the B-Tree |
| USED_SPACE | NUMBER | Total space that is currently being used in the B-Tree |
| PCT_USED | NUMBER | Percent of space allocated in the B-Tree that is being used |
| ROWS_PER_KEY | NUMBER | Average number of rows per distinct key (this figure is calculated without consideration of deleted rows) |
| BLKS_GETS_PER_ACCESS | NUMBER | Expected number of consistent mode block reads per row, assuming that a randomly chosen row is accessed using the index. Used to calculate the number of consistent reads that will occur during an index scan. |
| PRE_ROWS | NUMBER | Number of prefix rows (values in the index) |
| PRE_ROWS_LEN | NUMBER | Sum of lengths of all prefix rows |
| OPT_CMPR_COUNT | NUMBER | Optimal index compression length |
| OPT_CMPR_PCTSAVE | NUMBER | Corresponding space savings after an ANALYZE |
| DEL_LF_CMP_ROWS | NUMBER | Number of deleted rows that are within a compression unit (CU) |
| PRG_LF_CMP_ROWS | NUMBER | Number of purged rows that are within a CU |
| LF_CMP_ROWS | NUMBER | Number of rows that are in a CU or prefix compressed |
| LF_CMP_ROWS_LEN | NUMBER | Sum of lengths of all prefix rows and CUs |
| LF_UNCMP_ROWS | NUMBER | Number of rows that are neither in a CU nor prefix compressed |
| LF_UNCMP_ROWS_LEN | NUMBER | Sum of lengths of rows that are neither in a CU nor prefix compressed |
| LF_SUF_ROWS_LEN | NUMBER | Sum of lengths of suffix rows |
| LF_CMP_ROWS_UNCMP_LEN | NUMBER | Sum of the uncompressed lengths of rows that are in a CU or prefix compressed |
| LF_CMP_RECMP_COUNT | NUMBER | Sum of CU recompression counts |
| LF_CMP_LOCK_VEC_LEN | NUMBER | Sum of CU lock vector lengths |
| LF_CMP_BLKS | NUMBER | Number of blocks that have a CU or nonzero prefix column count |
| LF_UNCMP_BLKS | NUMBER | Number of blocks that do not have a CU and have a zero prefix column count |
