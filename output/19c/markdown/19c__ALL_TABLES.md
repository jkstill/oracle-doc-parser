## Usage Notes

Related Views DBA_TABLES describes all relational tables in the database. USER_TABLES describes the relational tables owned by the current user. This view does not display the OWNER column. Note: Columns marked with an asterisk ( * ) are populated only if you collect statistics on the table with the DBMS_STATS package. Note: Columns marked with an asterisk ( * ) are populated only if you collect statistics on the table with the DBMS_STATS package. Examples This SQL query returns the names of the tables in the EXAMPLES tablespace: SELECT table_name FROM all_tables WHERE tablespace_name = 'EXAMPLE' ORDER BY table_name; This SQL query returns the name of the tablespace that contains the HR schema: SELECT DISTINCT tablespace_name FROM all_tables WHERE owner='HR'; See Also: " DBA_TABLES " " USER_TABLES " " PARALLEL_INSTANCE_GROUP " Oracle Database PL/SQL Packages and Types Reference for more information about the DBMS_STATS package
