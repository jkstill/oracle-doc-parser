# DBA_HIST_MTTR_TARGET_ADVICE

DBA_HIST_MTTR_TARGET_ADVICE displays historical predictions of the number of physical I/O requests for the MTTR corresponding to each row.

## Columns

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| SNAP_ID | NUMBER | Unique snapshot ID |
| DBID | NUMBER | Database ID for the snapshot |
| INSTANCE_NUMBER | NUMBER | Instance number for the snapshot |
| MTTR_TARGET_FOR_ESTIMATE | NUMBER | MTTR setting being simulated (equal to the current MTTR setting if this is the first row of the view) |
| ADVICE_STATUS | VARCHAR2(5) | Current status of MTTR simulation: ON SET READY SET OFF |
| DIRTY_LIMIT | NUMBER | Dirty buffer limit derived from the MTTR being simulated |
| ESTD_CACHE_WRITES | NUMBER | Estimated number of cache physical writes under the MTTR |
| ESTD_CACHE_WRITE_FACTOR | NUMBER | Estimated cache physical write ratio under the MTTR. It is the ratio of the estimated number of cache writes to the number of cache writes under the current MTTR setting. |
| ESTD_TOTAL_WRITES | NUMBER | Estimated total number of physical writes under the MTTR |
| ESTD_TOTAL_WRITE_FACTOR | NUMBER | Estimated total physical write ratio under the MTTR. It is the ratio of the estimated total number of physical writes to the total number of physical writes under the current MTTR setting. |
| ESTD_TOTAL_IOS | NUMBER | Estimated total number of I/O requests under the MTTR |
| ESTD_TOTAL_IO_FACTOR | NUMBER | Estimated total I/O ratio under the MTTR. It is the ratio of the estimated total number of I/O requests to the total number of I/O requests under the current MTTR setting. |
| CON_DBID | NUMBER | The database ID of the PDB for the sampled session |
| CON_ID | NUMBER | The ID of the container that CON_DBID identifies. Possible values include: 0 : This value is used for rows containing data that pertain to the entire CDB. This value is also used for rows in non-CDBs. 1 : This value is used for rows containing data that pertain to only the root n : Where n is the applicable container ID for the rows containing data |

## Usage Notes

The data also includes a physical I/O factor, which is the ratio of the number of estimated I/O requests to the number of I/O requests actually performed by the current MTTR setting during the measurement interval.
