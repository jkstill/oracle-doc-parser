| HIGH_VALUE | RAW(1000) | High value in the column |
| DENSITY | NUMBER | If a histogram is available on COLUMN_NAME , then this column displays the selectivity of a value that spans fewer than 2 endpoints in the histogram.

| NUM_BUCKETS | NUMBER | Number of buckets in histogram for the column |
| LAST_ANALYZED | DATE | Date on which this column was most recently analyzed |
| SAMPLE_SIZE | NUMBER | Sample size used in analyzing this column |
| GLOBAL_STATS | VARCHAR2(3) | GLOBAL_STATS will be YES if statistics are gathered or incrementally maintained, otherwise it will be NO |
| USER_STATS | VARCHAR2(3) | Indicates whether statistics were entered directly by the user ( YES ) or not ( NO ) |
| NOTES | VARCHAR2(99) | Describes some additional properties of the statistics. For example: A value of INCREMENTAL indicates that the global statistics are derived from synopses, that is, the global statistics are incrementally maintained. A value of STATS_ON_CONVENTIONAL_LOAD indicates that the statistics are obtained by online statistics gathering for conventional DML. Foot 1 |
| AVG_COL_LEN | NUMBER | Average length of the column (in bytes) |
| HISTOGRAM | VARCHAR2(15) | Indicates existence/type of histogram: NONE FREQUENCY HEIGHT BALANCED HYBRID TOP-FREQUENCY |
| SCOPE | VARCHAR2(7) | The value is SHARED for statistics gathered on any table other than global temporary tables. For a global tempoary table, the possible values are: SESSION - Indicates that the statistics are session-specific SHARED - Indicates that the statistics are shared across all sessions See Oracle Database PL/SQL Packages and Types Reference for information about using the GLOBAL_TEMP_TABLE_STATS preference of the DBMS_STATS package to control whether to gather session or shared statistics for global temporary tables. |
