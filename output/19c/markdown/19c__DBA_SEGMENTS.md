# DBA_SEGMENTS

DBA_SEGMENTS describes the storage allocated for all segments in the database.

## Columns

| OWNER | VARCHAR2(128) | Username of the segment owner |
| SEGMENT_NAME | VARCHAR2(128) | Name, if any, of the segment |
| PARTITION_NAME | VARCHAR2(128) | Object Partition Name (Set to NULL for nonpartitioned objects) |
| SEGMENT_TYPE | VARCHAR2(18) | Type of segment: NESTED TABLE TABLE TABLE PARTITION CLUSTER LOBINDEX INDEX INDEX PARTITION LOBSEGMENT TABLE SUBPARTITION INDEX SUBPARTITION LOB PARTITION LOB SUBPARTITION ROLLBACK TYPE2 UNDO DEFERRED ROLLBACK TEMPORARY CACHE SPACE HEADER UNDEFINED |
| SEGMENT_SUBTYPE | VARCHAR2(10) | Subtype of LOB segment: SECUREFILE , ASSM , MSSM , and NULL |
| TABLESPACE_NAME | VARCHAR2(30) | Name of the tablespace containing the segment |
| HEADER_FILE | NUMBER | Absolute file number of the data file containing the segment header |
| HEADER_BLOCK | NUMBER | ID of the block containing the segment header |
| BYTES | NUMBER | Size, in bytes, of the segment |
| BLOCKS | NUMBER | Size, in Oracle blocks, of the segment |
| EXTENTS | NUMBER | Number of extents allocated to the segment |
| INITIAL_EXTENT | NUMBER | Size in bytes requested for the initial extent of the segment at create time. (Oracle rounds the extent size to multiples of 5 blocks if the requested size is greater than 5 blocks.) |
| NEXT_EXTENT | NUMBER | Size in bytes of the next extent to be allocated to the segment |
| MIN_EXTENTS | NUMBER | Minimum number of extents allowed in the segment |
| MAX_EXTENTS | NUMBER | Maximum number of extents allowed in the segment |
| MAX_SIZE | NUMBER | Maximum number of blocks allowed in the segment |
| RETENTION | VARCHAR2(7) | Retention option for SECUREFILE segment |
| MINRETENTION | NUMBER | Minimum retention duration for SECUREFILE segment |
| PCT_INCREASE | NUMBER | Percent by which to increase the size of the next extent to be allocated |
| FREELISTS | NUMBER | Number of process freelists allocated to this segment |
| FREELIST_GROUPS | NUMBER | Number of freelist groups allocated to this segment |
| RELATIVE_FNO | NUMBER | Relative file number of the segment header |
| BUFFER_POOL | VARCHAR2(7) | Buffer pool to be used for segment blocks: DEFAULT KEEP RECYCLE |
| FLASH_CACHE | VARCHAR2(7) | Database Smart Flash Cache hint to be used for segment blocks: DEFAULT KEEP NONE Solaris and Oracle Linux functionality only. |
| CELL_FLASH_CACHE | VARCHAR2(7) | Cell flash cache hint to be used for segment blocks: DEFAULT KEEP NONE See Also: Oracle Exadata Storage Server Software documentation for more information |
| INMEMORY | VARCHAR2(8) | Indicates whether the In-Memory Column Store (IM column store) is enabled ( ENABLED ) or disabled ( DISABLED ) for this segment |
| INMEMORY_PRIORITY | VARCHAR2(8) | Indicates the priority for In-Memory Column Store (IM column store) population: LOW MEDIUM HIGH CRITICAL NONE NULL |
| INMEMORY_DISTRIBUTE | VARCHAR2(15) | Indicates how the IM column store is distributed in an Oracle Real Application Clusters (Oracle RAC) environment: AUTO BY ROWID RANGE BY PARTITION BY SUBPARTITION |
| INMEMORY_DUPLICATE | VARCHAR2(13) | Indicates the duplicate setting for the IM column store in an Oracle RAC environment: NO DUPLICATE DUPLICATE DUPLICATE ALL |
| INMEMORY_COMPRESSION | VARCHAR2(17) | Indicates the compression level for the IM column store: NO MEMCOMPRESS FOR DML FOR QUERY [ LOW | HIGH ] FOR CAPACITY [ LOW | HIGH ] NULL |
| CELLMEMORY Foot 1 Foot 1 | VARCHAR2(24) | The value for columnar compression in the storage cell flash cache. Possible values: ENABLED : Oracle Exadata Storage will decide automatically whether to cache in columnar form DISABLED : Oracle Exadata Storage is prevented from caching in columnar form NO CACHECOMPRESS : Oracle Exadata Storage will cache in HCC format (no recompression) FOR QUERY : Oracle Exadata Storage will recompress and cache in INMEMORY query high format FOR CAPACITY : Oracle Exadata Storage will recompress and cache in INMEMORY capacity low format |
