# RESOURCE_MANAGE_GOLDENGATE

RESOURCE_MANAGE_GOLDENGATE determines whether Oracle GoldenGate apply processes in the database are resource managed.

## Usage Notes

Property Description Parameter type Boolean Default value false Modifiable ALTER SYSTEM Modifiable in a PDB No Range of values true | false Basic No Oracle RAC All instances should use the same value. To enable Resource Manager, set the RESOURCE_MANAGER_PLAN parameter. By default, Oracle GoldenGate apply processes in the database are not resource managed. Given that replication to a PDB requires a separate Oracle GoldenGate apply process, it is possible that the apply processes for one PDB could end up consuming most of the CPU on the machine, even if there is a CPU resource management plan in place to limit CPU usage per PDB. You can set the following values for the RESOURCE_MANAGE_GOLDENGATE parameter: TRUE : With this setting, Oracle GoldenGate apply processes in the database are resource managed based on the resources allocated to the GoldenGate apply user. FALSE : With this setting, Oracle GoldenGate apply processes are not resource managed.
