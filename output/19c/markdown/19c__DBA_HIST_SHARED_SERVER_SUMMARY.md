# DBA_HIST_SHARED_SERVER_SUMMARY

DBA_HIST_SHARED_SERVER_SUMMARY displays historical information for shared servers.

## Columns

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| SNAP_ID | NUMBER | Unique snapshot ID |
| DBID | NUMBER | Database ID for the snapshot |
| INSTANCE_NUMBER | NUMBER | Instance number for the snapshot |
| NUM_SAMPLES | NUMBER | Total number of samples |
| SAMPLE_TIME | NUMBER | Last sample timestamp |
| SAMPLED_TOTAL_CONN | NUMBER | Cumulative sum of total number of connections over all samples. To determine the average number of connections between two snapshots, divide the difference in SAMPLED_TOTAL_CONN by the difference in NUM_SAMPLES . |
| SAMPLED_ACTIVE_CONN | NUMBER | Cumulative sum of active number of connections over all samples. To determine the average number of active connections between two snapshots, divide the difference in SAMPLED_ACTIVE_CONN by the difference in NUM_SAMPLES . |
| SAMPLED_TOTAL_SRV | NUMBER | Cumulative sum of total number of servers over all samples. To determine the average number of servers between two snapshots, divide the difference in SAMPLED_TOTAL_SRV by the difference in NUM_SAMPLES . |
| SAMPLED_ACTIVE_SRV | NUMBER | Cumulative sum of active number of servers over all samples. To determine the average number of active servers between two snapshots, divide the difference in SAMPLED_ACTIVE_SRV by the difference in NUM_SAMPLES . |
| SAMPLED_TOTAL_DISP | NUMBER | Cumulative sum of total number of dispatchers over all samples. To determine the average number of dispatchers between two snapshots, divide the difference in SAMPLED_TOTAL_DISP by the difference in NUM_SAMPLES . |
| SAMPLED_ACTIVE_DISP | NUMBER | Cumulative sum of active number of dispatchers over all samples. To determine the average number of active dispatchers between two snapshots, divide the difference in SAMPLED_ACTIVE_DISP by the difference in NUM_SAMPLES . |
| SRV_BUSY | NUMBER | Total shared server busy time (in hundredths of a second) |
| SRV_IDLE | NUMBER | Total shared server idle time (in hundredths of a second) |
| SRV_IN_NET | NUMBER | Total shared server incoming network wait time (in hundredths of a second). This includes waits for receives and resets. This time is also included in SRV_BUSY . |
| SRV_OUT_NET | NUMBER | Total shared server outgoing network wait time (in hundredths of a second). This includes waits for sends and outbound connection requests. This time is also included in SRV_BUSY . |
| SRV_MESSAGES | NUMBER | Number of messages processed |
| SRV_BYTES | NUMBER | Total number of bytes in all messages |
| CQ_WAIT | NUMBER | Total time that all items in the common queue have waited (in hundredths of a second) |
| CQ_TOTALQ | NUMBER | Total number of items that have ever been in the common queue |
| DQ_TOTALQ | NUMBER | Total number of items that have ever been in a dispatcher queue |
| CON_DBID | NUMBER | The database ID of the PDB for the sampled session |
| CON_ID | NUMBER | The ID of the container that CON_DBID identifies. Possible values include: 0 : This value is used for rows containing data that pertain to the entire CDB. This value is also used for rows in non-CDBs. 1 : This value is used for rows containing data that pertain to only the root n : Where n is the applicable container ID for the rows containing data |

## Usage Notes

This includes information about shared server activity, the servers, common queues, and dispatcher queues. This view obtains information from V$SHARED_SERVER , V$DISPATCHER , V$CIRCUIT , and V$QUEUE , and is aggregated over all servers, dispatchers, queues, and circuits. See Also: " V$SHARED_SERVER " " V$DISPATCHER " " V$CIRCUIT " " V$QUEUE " See Also: " V$SHARED_SERVER " " V$DISPATCHER " " V$CIRCUIT " " V$QUEUE "
