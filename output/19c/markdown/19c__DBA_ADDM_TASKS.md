| BEGIN_SNAP_ID | NUMBER | The snapshot ID that starts the analysis period |

| REQUESTED_ANALYSIS | VARCHAR2(8) | The type of ADDM analysis that was requested before task execution, as follows: DATABASE - global ADDM INSTANCE - local ADDM PARTIAL - continental ADDM |
| ACTUAL_ANALYSIS | VARCHAR2(8) | The type of ADDM analysis that was actually performed when the task was executed (either DATABASE , INSTANCE , or PARTIAL ) |

If the value of this column is different from the value of the DB_TYPE_DETECTED column, then ADDM ignored the detected open mode of the database and analyzed the task as if it occurred on a database with the assumed open mode. Possible values: READ-ONLY READ-WRITE |
| CDB_TYPE_DETECTED Foot 1 | VARCHAR2(25) | Indicates the type of database that the task was analyzing, as detected by ADDM.

| CDB_TYPE_ANALYZED Foot 1 | VARCHAR2(25) | Indicates the assumed type of database that the task was analyzing. If the value of this column is different from the value of the CDB_TYPE_DETECTED column, then ADDM ignored the detected type of database and analyzed the task as if it occurred on the assumed type of database.
