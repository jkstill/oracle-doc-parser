# DBA_HIST_SQLBIND

DBA_HIST_SQLBIND displays historical information on bind variables used by SQL cursors.

## Columns

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| SNAP_ID | NUMBER | Unique snapshot ID |
| DBID | NUMBER | Database ID for the snapshot |
| INSTANCE_NUMBER | NUMBER | Instance number for the snapshot |
| SQL_ID | VARCHAR2(13) | SQL identifier of the parent cursor in the library cache |
| NAME | VARCHAR2(128) | Name of the bind variable |
| POSITION | NUMBER | Position of the bind variable in the SQL statement |
| DUP_POSITION | NUMBER | If the binding is performed by name and the bind variable is duplicated, then this column gives the position of the primary bind variable. |
| DATATYPE | NUMBER | Internal identifier for the bind data type. Beginning in Oracle Database 12 c , a number representing a PL/SQL data type can appear in this column. |
| DATATYPE_STRING | VARCHAR2(15) | Textual representation of the bind data type. Beginning in Oracle Database 12 c , a text representation of a PL/SQL-only data type can appear in this column. If the actual data type is a PL/SQL sub type, the name of the data type, not the sub type will be displayed. |
| CHARACTER_SID | NUMBER | National character set identifier |
| PRECISION | NUMBER | Precision (for numeric binds) |
| SCALE | NUMBER | Scale (for numeric binds) |
| MAX_LENGTH | NUMBER | Maximum bind length |
| WAS_CAPTURED | VARCHAR2(3) | Indicates whether the bind value was captured ( YES ) or not ( NO ) |
| LAST_CAPTURED | DATE | Date when the bind value was captured. Bind values are captured when SQL statements are executed. To limit the overhead, binds are captured at most every 15 minutes for a given cursor. |
| VALUE_STRING | VARCHAR2(4000) | Value of the bind represented as a string |
| VALUE_ANYDATA | ANYDATA | Value of the bind represented using the self-descriptive Sys.AnyData data type. This representation is useful to programmatically decode the value of the bind variable. This column is NULL if a PL/SQL-only data type appears in the DATATYPE column. |
| CON_DBID | NUMBER | The database ID of the PDB for the sampled session |
| CON_ID | NUMBER | The ID of the container that CON_DBID identifies. Possible values include: 0 : This value is used for rows containing data that pertain to the entire CDB. This value is also used for rows in non-CDBs. 1 : This value is used for rows containing data that pertain to only the root n : Where n is the applicable container ID for the rows containing data |
