## Usage Notes

DBA_HIST_ACTIVE_SESS_HISTORY contains snapshots of V$ACTIVE_SESSION_HISTORY . See " V$ACTIVE_SESSION_HISTORY " for further interpretation details for many of these columns (except SNAP_ID , DBID , and INSTANCE_NUMBER ). Note: If you want to perform a join with the snapshots view, use the DBA_HIST_ASH_SNAPSHOT view instead of the DBA_HIST_SNAPSHOT view. Note: If you want to perform a join with the snapshots view, use the DBA_HIST_ASH_SNAPSHOT view instead of the DBA_HIST_SNAPSHOT view.
