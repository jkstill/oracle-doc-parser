| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| SCHEMA | VARCHAR2(128) | Source queue owner |
| QNAME | VARCHAR2(128) | Source queue name |
| DESTINATION | VARCHAR2(395) | Destination name, currently limited to be a DBLINK name |

| LATENCY | NUMBER | Maximum wait time to propagate a message during the propagation window |
| SCHEDULE_DISABLED | VARCHAR2(1) | Indicates whether the schedule is disabled ( Y ) or enabled ( N ). If disabled, then the schedule will not be executed. |
| PROCESS_NAME | VARCHAR2(4) | Name of the process executing the schedule; NULL if not currently executing |
| SESSION_ID | VARCHAR2(82) | Session ID and session serial number of the job executing this schedule (SID, SERIAL#); NULL if not currently executing |

| LAST_RUN_TIME | VARCHAR2(8) | Time of day of the last successful execution (in HH:MI:SS format) |
| CURRENT_START_DATE | TIMESTAMP(6) WITH TIME ZONE | Date at which the current window of this schedule was started |
| CURRENT_START_TIME | VARCHAR2(8) | Time of day at which the current window of this schedule was started (in HH:MI:SS format) |
| NEXT_RUN_DATE | TIMESTAMP(6) WITH TIME ZONE | Date at which the next window of this schedule will be started |
| NEXT_RUN_TIME | VARCHAR2(8) | Time of day at which the next window of this schedule will be started (in HH:MI:SS format) |
| TOTAL_TIME | NUMBER | Total time spent by the system in executing this schedule (in seconds) |
| TOTAL_NUMBER | NUMBER | Total number of messages propagated in this schedule |

| MAX_NUMBER | NUMBER | Maximum number of messages propagated in a propagation window |
| MAX_BYTES | NUMBER | Maximum number of bytes propagated in a propagation window |
| AVG_NUMBER | NUMBER | Average number of messages propagated in a propagation window |
| AVG_SIZE | NUMBER | Average size of a propagated message (in bytes) |
| AVG_TIME | NUMBER | Average time to propagate a message (in seconds) |

| LAST_ERROR_TIME | VARCHAR2(8) | Time of day of the last unsuccessful execution (in HH:MI:SS format) |
| LAST_ERROR_MSG | VARCHAR2(4000) | Error number and error message text of the last unsuccessful execution |
| MESSAGE_DELIVERY_MODE | VARCHAR2(10) | Message delivery mode: PERSISTENT BUFFERED |
