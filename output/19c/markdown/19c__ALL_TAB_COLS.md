# ALL_TAB_COLS

ALL_TAB_COLS describes the columns of the tables, views, and clusters accessible to the current user.

## Columns

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| OWNER | VARCHAR2(128) | Owner of the table, view, or cluster |
| TABLE_NAME | VARCHAR2(128) | Name of the table, view, or cluster |
| COLUMN_NAME | VARCHAR2(128) | Column name |
| DATA_TYPE | VARCHAR2(128) | Data type of the column |
| DATA_TYPE_MOD | VARCHAR2(3) | Data type modifier of the column |
| DATA_TYPE_OWNER | VARCHAR2(128) | Owner of the data type of the column |
| DATA_LENGTH | NUMBER | Length of the column (in bytes) |
| DATA_PRECISION | NUMBER | Decimal precision for NUMBER datatype; binary precision for FLOAT datatype; NULL for all other datatypes |
| DATA_SCALE | NUMBER | Digits to the right of the decimal point in a number |
| NULLABLE | VARCHAR2(1) | Indicates whether a column allows NULLs. The value is N if there is a NOT NULL constraint on the column or if the column is part of a PRIMARY KEY . |
| COLUMN_ID | NUMBER | Sequence number of the column as created |
| DEFAULT_LENGTH | NUMBER | Length of the default value for the column |
| DATA_DEFAULT | LONG | Default value for the column |
| NUM_DISTINCT | NUMBER | Number of distinct values in the column. This column remains for backward compatibility with Oracle7. This information is now in the {TAB|PART}_COL_STATISTICS views. |
| LOW_VALUE | RAW(1000) | Low value in the column. This column remains for backward compatibility with Oracle7. This information is now in the {TAB|PART}_COL_STATISTICS views. |
| HIGH_VALUE | RAW(1000) | High value in the column. This column remains for backward compatibility with Oracle7. This information is now in the {TAB|PART}_COL_STATISTICS views. |
| DENSITY | NUMBER | If a histogram is available on COLUMN_NAME , then this column displays the selectivity of a value that spans fewer than 2 endpoints in the histogram. It does not represent the selectivity of values that span 2 or more endpoints. If a histogram is not available on COLUMN_NAME , then the value of this column is 1 / NUM_DISTINCT . This column remains for backward compatibility with Oracle7. This information is now in the {TAB|PART}_COL_STATISTICS views. |
| NUM_NULLS | NUMBER | Number of NULLs in the column |
| NUM_BUCKETS | NUMBER | Number of buckets in the histogram for the column Note: The number of buckets in a histogram is specified in the SIZE parameter of the ANALYZE SQL statement. However, Oracle Database does not create a histogram with more buckets than the number of rows in the sample. Also, if the sample contains any values that are very repetitious, Oracle Database creates the specified number of buckets, but the value indicated by this column may be smaller because of an internal compression algorithm. |
| LAST_ANALYZED | DATE | Date on which this column was most recently analyzed |
| SAMPLE_SIZE | NUMBER | Sample size used in analyzing this column |
| CHARACTER_SET_NAME | VARCHAR2(44) | Name of the character set: CHAR_CS NCHAR_CS |
| CHAR_COL_DECL_LENGTH | NUMBER | Declaration length of the character type column |
| GLOBAL_STATS | VARCHAR2(3) | GLOBAL_STATS will be YES if statistics are gathered or incrementally maintained, otherwise it will be NO |
| USER_STATS | VARCHAR2(3) | Indicates whether statistics were entered directly by the user ( YES ) or not ( NO ) |
| AVG_COL_LEN | NUMBER | Average length of the column (in bytes) |
| CHAR_LENGTH | NUMBER | Displays the length of the column in characters. This value only applies to the following datatypes: CHAR VARCHAR2 NCHAR NVARCHAR2 |
| CHAR_USED | VARCHAR2(1) | Indicates that the column uses BYTE length semantics ( B ) or CHAR length semantics ( C ), or whether the datatype is not any of the following (NULL): CHAR VARCHAR2 NCHAR NVARCHAR2 |
| V80_FMT_IMAGE | VARCHAR2(3) | Indicates whether the column data is in release 8.0 image format ( YES ) or not ( NO ) |
| DATA_UPGRADED | VARCHAR2(3) | Indicates whether the column data has been upgraded to the latest type version format ( YES ) or not ( NO ) |
| HIDDEN_COLUMN | VARCHAR2(3) | Indicates whether the column is a hidden column ( YES ) or not ( NO ) |
| VIRTUAL_COLUMN | VARCHAR2(3) | Indicates whether the column is a virtual column ( YES ) or not ( NO ) |
| SEGMENT_COLUMN_ID | NUMBER | Sequence number of the column in the segment |
| INTERNAL_COLUMN_ID | NUMBER | Internal sequence number of the column |
| HISTOGRAM | VARCHAR2(15) | Indicates existence/type of histogram: NONE FREQUENCY TOP-FREQUENCY HEIGHT BALANCED HYBRID |
| QUALIFIED_COL_NAME | VARCHAR2(4000) | Qualified column name |
| USER_GENERATED | VARCHAR2(3) | Indicates whether the column is a user-generated column ( YES ) or a system-generated column ( NO ). Invisible columns are hidden columns that are also user- generated columns. |
| DEFAULT_ON_NULL | VARCHAR2(3) | Indicates whether the column has DEFAULT ON NULL semantics ( YES ) or not ( NO ) |
| IDENTITY_COLUMN | VARCHAR2(3) | Indicates whether this is an identity column ( YES ) or not ( NO ) |
| EVALUATION_EDITION | VARCHAR2(128) | Name of the edition in which editioned objects referenced in an expression column are resolved |
| UNUSABLE_BEFORE | VARCHAR2(128) | Name of the oldest edition in which the column is usable |
| UNUSABLE_BEGINNING | VARCHAR2(128) | Name of the oldest edition in which the column becomes perpetually unusable |
| COLLATION | VARCHAR2(100) | Collation for the column. Only applies to columns with character data types. |
| COLLATED_COLUMN_ID | NUMBER | Internal sequence number of a column, for which this virtual column generates a collation key. |

## Usage Notes

To gather statistics for this view, use the DBMS_STATS package. This view differs from ALL_TAB_COLUMNS in that system-generated hidden columns are not filtered out. Related Views DBA_TAB_COLS describes the columns of all tables, views, and clusters in the database. USER_TAB_COLS describes the columns of the tables, views, and clusters owned by the current user. This view does not display the OWNER column.
