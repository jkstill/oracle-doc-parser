# DBA_HIST_INSTANCE_RECOVERY

DBA_HIST_INSTANCE_RECOVERY displays the historical monitoring of the mechanisms available to the user to limit recovery I/O.

## Columns

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| SNAP_ID | NUMBER | Unique snapshot ID |
| DBID | NUMBER | Database ID for the snapshot |
| INSTANCE_NUMBER | NUMBER | Instance number for the snapshot |
| RECOVERY_ESTIMATED_IOS | NUMBER | Number of dirty buffers in the buffer cache. |
| ACTUAL_REDO_BLKS | NUMBER | Current actual number of redo blocks required for recovery |
| TARGET_REDO_BLKS | NUMBER | Current target number of redo blocks that must be processed for recovery. This value is the minimum value of the following 3 columns, and identifies which of the 3 user-defined limits determines checkpointing. |
| LOG_FILE_SIZE_REDO_BLKS | NUMBER | Maximum number of redo blocks required to guarantee that a log switch does not occur before the checkpoint completes |
| LOG_CHKPT_TIMEOUT_REDO_BLKS | NUMBER | Number of redo blocks that need to be processed during recovery to satisfy the LOG_CHECKPOINT_TIMEOUT parameter. The value displayed is not meaningful unless LOG_CHECKPOINT_TIMEOUT has been set. |
| LOG_CHKPT_INTERVAL_REDO_BLKS | NUMBER | Number of redo blocks that need to be processed during recovery to satisfy the LOG_CHECKPOINT_INTERVAL parameter. The value displayed is not meaningful unless LOG_CHECKPOINT_INTERVAL has been set. |
| FAST_START_IO_TARGET_REDO_BLKS | NUMBER | This column is obsolete and maintained for backward compatibility. The value of this column is always null. |
| TARGET_MTTR | NUMBER | Effective MTTR (mean time to recover) target value in seconds. The TARGET_MTTR value is calculated based on the value of the FAST_START_MTTR_TARGET parameter (the TARGET_MTTR value is used internally), and is usually an approximation of the parameter's value. However, if the FAST_START_MTTR_TARGET parameter value is very small (for example, one second), or very large (for example, 3600 seconds), then the calculation will produce a target value dictated by system limitations. In such cases, the TARGET_MTTR value will be the shortest calculated time, or the longest calculated time that recovery is expected to take. If FAST_START_MTTR_TARGET is not specified, then the value of this field is the current estimated MTTR. |
| ESTIMATED_MTTR | NUMBER | Current estimated mean time to recover (MTTR) based on the number of dirty buffers and log blocks ( 0 if FAST_START_MTTR_TARGET is not specified). This value tells you how long you can expect recovery to take based on the work the system is doing right now. |
| CKPT_BLOCK_WRITES | NUMBER | Number of blocks written by checkpoint writes |
| OPTIMAL_LOGFILE_SIZE | NUMBER | Redo log file size (in megabytes) that is considered optimal based on the current setting of FAST_START_MTTR_TARGET . It is recommended that all online redo logs be configured to be at least this value. |
| ESTD_CLUSTER_AVAILABLE_TIME | NUMBER | Estimated time (in seconds) that the cluster would become partially available should the instance fail. This column is only meaningful in an Oracle Real Application Clusters (Oracle RAC) environment. In a non-Oracle RAC environment, the value of this column is null. |
| WRITES_MTTR | NUMBER | Number of writes driven by the FAST_START_MTTR_TARGET parameter |
| WRITES_LOGFILE_SIZE | NUMBER | Number of writes driven by the smallest redo log file size |
| WRITES_LOG_CHECKPOINT_SETTINGS | NUMBER | Number of writes driven by the LOG_CHECKPOINT_INTERVAL parameter or the LOG_CHECKPOINT_TIMEOUT parameter |
| WRITES_OTHER_SETTINGS | NUMBER | Number of writes driven by other reasons (such as the deprecated FAST_START_IO_TARGET parameter) |
| WRITES_AUTOTUNE | NUMBER | Number of writes due to auto-tune checkpointing |
| WRITES_FULL_THREAD_CKPT | NUMBER | Number of writes due to full thread checkpoints |
| CON_DBID | NUMBER | The database ID of the PDB for the sampled session |
| CON_ID | NUMBER | The ID of the container that CON_DBID identifies. Possible values include: 0 : This value is used for rows containing data that pertain to the entire CDB. This value is also used for rows in non-CDBs. 1 : This value is used for rows containing data that pertain to only the root n : Where n is the applicable container ID for the rows containing data |
