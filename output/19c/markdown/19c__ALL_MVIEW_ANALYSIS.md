# ALL_MVIEW_ANALYSIS

DBA_MVIEW_ANALYSIS describes all such materialized views in the database.

## Columns

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| OWNER | VARCHAR2(128) | Owner of the materialized view |
| MVIEW_NAME | VARCHAR2(128) | Name of the materialized view |
| MVIEW_TABLE_OWNER | VARCHAR2(128) | Owner of the container table (see next column) |
| CONTAINER_NAME | VARCHAR2(128) | Name of the internal container in which the materialized view data is held. Normally this is the same as MVIEW_NAME . For materialized views created before Oracle8 i , Oracle Database attaches the 6-byte prefix SNAP$_ . If MVIEW_NAME has more than 19 bytes, then Oracle Database truncates the name to 19 bytes and adds a 4-byte sequence number as a suffix to produce a nonambiguous CONTAINER_NAME . |
| LAST_REFRESH_SCN | NUMBER | System change number (SCN) of the last refresh operation |
| LAST_REFRESH_DATE | DATE | SYSDATE of the last refresh |
| REFRESH_METHOD | VARCHAR2(8) | Default refresh method: FORCE FAST COMPLETE NEVER |
| SUMMARY | VARCHAR2(1) | Indicates whether this materialized view includes a GROUP BY clause or aggregation ( Y ) or not ( N ) |
| FULLREFRESHTIM | NUMBER | Approximate refresh time, in seconds, for full refresh |
| INCREFRESHTIM | NUMBER | Approximate refresh time, in seconds, for fast refresh |
| CONTAINS_VIEWS | VARCHAR2(1) | Indicates whether this materialized view contains a view in its definition ( Y ) or not ( N ) |
| UNUSABLE | VARCHAR2(1) | Indicates whether this materialized view is UNUSABLE (inconsistent data) ( Y ) or not ( N ). A materialized view can be UNUSABLE if a system failure occurs during a full refresh. |
| RESTRICTED_SYNTAX | VARCHAR2(1) | Indicates whether this materialized view had a restriction in its defining query that limits the use of query rewrite ( Y ) or not ( N ). More complete information is provided by the REWRITE_CAPABILITY column of the *_MVIEWS view. |
| INC_REFRESHABLE | VARCHAR2(1) | Indicates whether this materialized view can be fast refreshed ( Y ) or not ( N ) |
| KNOWN_STALE | VARCHAR2(1) | Indicates whether the data contained in the materialized view is known to be inconsistent with the master table data because that has been updated since the last successful refresh ( Y ) or not ( N ) |
| INVALID | VARCHAR2(1) | Indicates whether this materialized view is in an invalid state (inconsistent metadata) ( Y ) or not ( N ) |
| REWRITE_ENABLED | VARCHAR2(1) | Indicates whether this materialized view is currently enabled for query rewrite ( Y ) or not ( N ) |
| QUERY_LEN | NUMBER | Length (in bytes) of the query field |
| QUERY | LONG | SELECT expression of the materialized view definition |
| REVISION | NUMBER | Reserved for internal use |
