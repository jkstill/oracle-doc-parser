# ALL_SQLSET_STATEMENTS

ALL_SQLSET_STATEMENTS displays information about the SQL statements, along with their statistics, that form all SQL tuning sets accessible to the current user.

## Columns

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| SQLSET_NAME | VARCHAR2(128) | Name of the SQL tuning set for the statement |
| SQLSET_OWNER | VARCHAR2(128) | User name of the SQL tuning set owner |
| SQLSET_ID | NUMBER | ID of the SQL tuning set for the statement |
| CON_DBID | NUMBER | The database ID of the PDB |
| SQL_ID | VARCHAR2(13) | SQL identifier of the parent cursor in the library cache |
| FORCE_MATCHING_SIGNATURE | NUMBER | The signature used when the CURSOR_SHARING parameter is set to FORCE |
| SQL_TEXT | CLOB | Full text for the SQL statement exposed as a CLOB column. |
| PARSING_SCHEMA_NAME | VARCHAR2(128) | Name of the user in whose schema the statement was parsed |
| PLAN_HASH_VALUE | NUMBER | Hash value for the plan corresponding to statistics in this record |
| BIND_DATA | RAW(2000) | Bind data |
| BINDS_CAPTURED | CHAR(1) | Binds captured |
| MODULE | VARCHAR2(64) | Contains the name of the module that was executing when the SQL statement was first parsed, which is set by calling DBMS_APPLICATION_INFO.SET_MODULE |
| ACTION | VARCHAR2(64) | Contains the name of the action that was executing when the SQL statement was first parsed, which is set by calling DBMS_APPLICATION_INFO.SET_ACTION |
| ELAPSED_TIME | NUMBER | Elapsed time (in microseconds) used by this cursor for parsing, executing, and fetching |
| CPU_TIME | NUMBER | CPU time (in microseconds) used by this cursor for parsing, executing, and fetching |
| BUFFER_GETS | NUMBER | Number of buffer gets for this child cursor |
| DISK_READS | NUMBER | Number of disk reads for this child cursor |
| DIRECT_WRITES | NUMBER | Number of direct writes for this child cursor |
| ROWS_PROCESSED | NUMBER | Total number of rows that the parsed SQL statement returns |
| FETCHES | NUMBER | Number of fetches associated with the SQL statement |
| EXECUTIONS | NUMBER | Number of executions that took place on this object since it was brought into the library cache |
| END_OF_FETCH_COUNT | NUMBER | Number of times this cursor was fully executed since the cursor was brought into the library cache. The value of this statistic in not incremented when the cursor is partially executed, either because it failed during the execution or because only the first few rows produced by this cursor are fetched before the cursor is closed or re-executed. By definition, the value of the END_OF_FETCH_COUNT column should be less than, or equal to, the value of the EXECUTIONS column. |
| OPTIMIZER_COST | NUMBER | Cost of this query, given by the optimizer |
| OPTIMIZER_ENV | RAW(2000) | Optimizer environment |
| PRIORITY | NUMBER | User-defined priority |
| COMMAND_TYPE | NUMBER | Oracle command type definition |
| FIRST_LOAD_TIME | VARCHAR2(19) | Timestamp of the parent creation time |
| STAT_PERIOD | NUMBER | Time (in seconds) during which the statistics of the SQL statement were collected |
| ACTIVE_STAT_PERIOD | NUMBER | Effective time (in seconds) during which the SQL statement was active |
| OTHER | CLOB | Client data, specified by the user, for this statement |
| PLAN_TIMESTAMP | DATE | Timestamp for the plan corresponding to the statistics in this record |
| SQL_SEQ | NUMBER | SQL sequence |
| LAST_EXEC_START_TIME | VARCHAR2(19) | For SQLs captured from the cursor cache, this is the time when the most recent execution of this SQL started |
